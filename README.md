### 👾 What I Do

I combine my skills to bring unique projects to life. My creative stack includes:

* **⛏️ Minecraft Modding:** I take the world of blocks to another dimension by creating mods that expand gameplay, add new mechanics, and introduce new challenges.
    * `Java` | `Forge`

* **💻 Front-End Development:** I build interactive, clean, and visually appealing web interfaces. I love watching a design come to life in the browser.
    * `HTML` | `CSS` | `JavaScript` | `React` | `Vue.js`

* **🎨 Multimedia Design & Editing:** From creating a logo to post-producing a video, I make sure that content not only works well but also looks amazing.
    * `Photoshop` | `Canva` | `Premiere Pro` | `Capcut`
